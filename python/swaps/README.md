## Pre-requisites 
You must have appropriate token balances and have granted relevant token allowances to the Balancer V2 Vault (0xBA12222222228d8Ba445958a75a0704d566BF2C8)
* If you need test ERC20 tokens: https://balancer-faucet.on.fleek.co/#/faucet
* Balancer Kovan UI: https://kovan.app.balancer.fi/#/

You must add an RPC address and private key to the relevant bash scripts. Do **NOT** commit private keys to Github. If you do, any valuable tokens send to that address will almost certainly be stolen.
